      A DataTable component
      Dash DataTable is an interactive table component designed for
      designed for viewing, editing, and exploring large datasets.
      DataTable is rendered with standard, semantic HTML <table/> markup,
      which makes it accessible, responsive, and easy to style. This
      component was written from scratch in React.js specifically for the
      Dash community. Its API was designed to be ergonomic and its behavior
      is completely customizable through its properties.
      
      - `id` (String; optional): The ID of the table.
      - `active_cell` (lists containing elements row, column, row_id, column_id   - `row` (optional)   - `column` (optional)   - `row_id` (String; optional)   - `column_id` (String; optional); optional): The row and column indices and IDs of the currently active cell.
      `row_id` is only returned if the data rows have an `id` key.
      - `cell_selectable` (Bool; optional): If True (default), then it is possible to click and navigate
      table cells.
      - `column_selectable` ('single', 'multi', false; optional): If `single`, then the uer can select a single column or group
      of merged columns via the radio button that will appear in the
      header rows.
      If `multi`, then the user can select multiple columns or groups
      of merged columns via the checkbox that will appear in the header
      rows.
      If false, then the user will not be able to select columns and no
      input will appear in the header rows.
      When a column is selected, its id will be contained in `selected_columns`
      and `derived_viewport_selected_columns`.
      - `columns` (optional):Columns describes various aspects about each individual column.
      `name` and `id` are the only required parameters.. columns has the following type: Array of lists containing elements clearable, deletable, editable, hideable, renamable, selectable, format, id, name, presentation, on_change, sort_as_null, validation, type   - `clearable` ('first', 'last' | Bool | Array of Bools; optional): If true, the user can clear the column by clicking on the `clear`
      action button on the column. If there are multiple header rows, true
      will display the action button on each row.
      If `last`, the `clear` action button will only appear on the last header
      row. If `first` it will only appear on the first header row. These
      are respectively shortcut equivalents to `[false, ..., false, true]` and
      `[true, false, ..., false]`.
      If there are merged, multi-header columns then you can choose
      which column header row to display the `clear` action button in by
      supplying an array of booleans.
      For example, `[true, false]` will display the `clear` action button
      on the first row, but not the second row.
      If the `clear` action button appears on a merged column, then clicking
      on that button will clear *all* of the merged columns associated with it.
      Unlike `column.deletable`, this action does not remove the column(s)
      from the table. It only removed the associated entries from `data`.   - `deletable` ('first', 'last' | Bool | Array of Bools; optional): If true, the user can remove the column by clicking on the `delete`
      action button on the column. If there are multiple header rows, true
      will display the action button on each row.
      If `last`, the `delete` action button will only appear on the last header
      row. If `first` it will only appear on the first header row. These
      are respectively shortcut equivalents to `[false, ..., false, true]` and
      `[true, false, ..., false]`.
      If there are merged, multi-header columns then you can choose
      which column header row to display the `delete` action button in by
      supplying an array of booleans.
      For example, `[true, false]` will display the `delete` action button
      on the first row, but not the second row.
      If the `delete` action button appears on a merged column, then clicking
      on that button will remove *all* of the merged columns associated with it.   - `editable` (Bool; optional): There are two `editable` flags in the table.
      This is the  column-level editable flag and there is
      also the table-level `editable` flag.
      These flags determine whether the contents of the table
      are editable or not.
      If the column-level `editable` flag is set it overrides
      the table-level `editable` flag for that column.   - `hideable` ('first', 'last' | Bool | Array of Bools; optional): If true, the user can hide the column by clicking on the `hide`
      action button on the column. If there are multiple header rows, true
      will display the action button on each row.
      If `last`, the `hide` action button will only appear on the last header
      row. If `first` it will only appear on the first header row. These
      are respectively shortcut equivalents to `[false, ..., false, true]` and
      `[true, false, ..., false]`.
      If there are merged, multi-header columns then you can choose
      which column header row to display the `hide` action button in by
      supplying an array of booleans.
      For example, `[true, false]` will display the `hide` action button
      on the first row, but not the second row.
      If the `hide` action button appears on a merged column, then clicking
      on that button will hide *all* of the merged columns associated with it.   - `renamable` ('first', 'last' | Bool | Array of Bools; optional): If true, the user can rename the column by clicking on the `rename`
      action button on the column. If there are multiple header rows, true
      will display the action button on each row.
      If `last`, the `rename` action button will only appear on the last header
      row. If `first` it will only appear on the first header row. These
      are respectively shortcut equivalents to `[false, ..., false, true]` and
      `[true, false, ..., false]`.
      If there are merged, multi-header columns then you can choose
      which column header row to display the `rename` action button in by
      supplying an array of booleans.
      For example, `[true, false]` will display the `rename` action button
      on the first row, but not the second row.
      If the `rename` action button appears on a merged column, then clicking
      on that button will rename *all* of the merged columns associated with it.   - `selectable` ('first', 'last' | Bool | Array of Bools; optional): If true, the user can select the column by clicking on the checkbox or radio button
      in the column. If there are multiple header rows, true will display the input
      on each row.
      If `last`, the input will only appear on the last header row. If `first` it will only
      appear on the first header row. These are respectively shortcut equivalents to
      `[false, ..., false, true]` and `[true, false, ..., false]`.
      If there are merged, multi-header columns then you can choose which column header
      row to display the input in by supplying an array of booleans.
      For example, `[true, false]` will display the `selectable` input on the first row,
      but now on the second row.
      If the `selectable` input appears on a merged columns, then clicking on that input
      will select *all* of the merged columns associated with it.
      The table-level prop `column_selectable` is used to determine the type of column
      selection to use.   - `format` (lists containing elements locale, nully, prefix, specifier   - `locale` (lists containing elements symbol, decimal, group, grouping, numerals, percent, separate_4digits   - `symbol` (Array of Strings; optional)   - `decimal` (String; optional)   - `group` (String; optional)   - `grouping` (Array of s; optional)   - `numerals` (Array of Strings; optional)   - `percent` (String; optional)   - `separate_4digits` (Bool; optional); optional)   - `nully` (Bool | Real | String | Dict | Array; optional)   - `prefix` (optional)   - `specifier` (String; optional); optional): The formatting applied to the column's data.
      This prop is derived from the [d3-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-format) library specification. Apart from
      being structured slightly differently (under a single prop), the usage
      is the same.
      'locale': represents localization specific formatting information.
       When left unspecified, will use the default value provided by d3-format.
       The keys are as follows:
       'symbol': (default: ['$', '']) a list of two strings representing the
       prefix and suffix symbols. Typically used for currency, and implemented using d3's
       currency format, but you can use this for other symbols such as measurement units;
       'decimal': (default: '.') the string used for the decimal separator;
       'group': (default: ',') the string used for the groups separator;
       'grouping': (default: [3]) a list of integers representing the grouping pattern.
       'numerals': a list of ten strings used as replacements for numbers 0-9;
       'percent': (default: '%') the string used for the percentage symbol;
       'separate_4digits': (default: True) separate integers with 4-digits or less.
      'nully': a value that will be used in place of the nully value during formatting.
        If the value type matches the column type, it will be formatted normally.
      'prefix': a number representing the SI unit to use during formatting.
        See `dash_table.Format.Prefix` enumeration for the list of valid values
      'specifier': (default: '') represents the rules to apply when formatting the number.
      dash_table.FormatTemplate contains helper functions to rapidly use certain
      typical number formats.   - `id` (String; required): The `id` of the column.
      The column `id` is used to match cells in data
      with particular columns.
      The `id` is not visible in the table.   - `name` (String | Array of Strings; required): The `name` of the column,
      as it appears in the column header.
      If `name` is a list of strings, then the columns
      will render with multiple headers rows.   - `presentation` ('input', 'dropdown', 'markdown'; optional): The `presentation` to use to display the value.
      Defaults to 'input' for ['datetime', 'numeric', 'text', 'any'].   - `on_change` (lists containing elements action, failure   - `action` ('coerce', 'none', 'validate'; optional)   - `failure` ('accept', 'default', 'reject'; optional); optional): The `on_change` behavior of the column for user-initiated modifications.
      'action' (default 'coerce'):
       none: do not validate data;
       coerce: check if the data corresponds to the destination type and
       attempts to coerce it into the destination type if not;
       validate: check if the data corresponds to the destination type (no coercion).
      'failure' (default 'reject'): what to do with the value if the action fails:
       accept: use the invalid value;
       default: replace the provided value with `validation.default`;
       reject: do not modify the existing value.   - `sort_as_null` (Array of String | Bools; optional): An array of string, number and boolean values that are treated as `null`
      (i.e. ignored and always displayed last) when sorting.
      This value overrides the table-level `sort_as_null`.   - `validation` (lists containing elements allow_null, default, allow_YY   - `allow_null` (Bool; optional)   - `default` (Bool | Real | String | Dict | Array; optional)   - `allow_YY` (Bool; optional); optional): The `validation` options.
      'allow_null': Allow the use of nully values. (undefined, null, NaN) (default: false)
      'default': The default value to apply with on_change.failure = 'default'. (default: null)
      'allow_YY': `datetime` columns only, allow 2-digit years (default: false).
        If true, we interpret years as ranging from now-70 to now+29 - in 2019
        this is 1949 to 2048 but in 2020 it will be different. If used with
        `action: 'coerce'`, will convert user input to a 4-digit year.   - `type` ('any', 'numeric', 'text', 'datetime'; optional): The data-type of the column's data.
      'numeric': represents both floats and ints.
      'text': represents a string.
      'datetime': a string representing a date or date-time, in the form:
        'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ssssss' or some truncation thereof. Years must
        have 4 digits, unless you use `validation.allow_YY: true`. Also
        accepts 'T' or 't' between date and time, and allows timezone info
        at the end. To convert these strings to Python `datetime` objects,
        use `dateutil.parser.isoparse`. In R use `parse_iso_8601` from the
        `parsedate` library.
        WARNING: these parsers do not work with 2-digit years, if you use
        `validation.allow_YY: true` and do not coerce to 4-digit years.
        And parsers that do work with 2-digit years may make a different
        guess about the century than we make on the front end.
      'any': represents any type of data.
      Defaults to 'any' if undefined.
      NOTE: This feature has not been fully implemented.
      In the future, it's data types will impact things like
      text formatting options in the cell (e.g. display 2 decimals
      for a number), filtering options and behavior, and editing
      behavior.
      Stay tuned by following [https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/166](https://github.com/plotly/dash-table/issues/166)s
      - `css` (Array of lists containing elements selector, rule   - `selector` (String; required)   - `rule` (String; required)s; optional): The `css` property is a way to embed CSS selectors and rules
      onto the page.
      We recommend starting with the `style_*` properties
      before using this `css` property.
      Example:
      [
          {"selector": ".dash-spreadsheet", "rule": 'font-family: "monospace"'}
      ]
      - `data` (Array of Dicts; optional): The contents of the table.
      The keys of each item in data should match the column IDs.
      Each item can also have an 'id' key, whose value is its row ID. If there
      is a column with ID='id' this will display the row ID, otherwise it is
      just used to reference the row for selections, filtering, etc.
      Example:
      [
           {'column-1': 4.5, 'column-2': 'montreal', 'column-3': 'canada'},
           {'column-1': 8, 'column-2': 'boston', 'column-3': 'america'}
      ]
      - `data_previous` (Array of Dicts; optional): The previous state of `data`. `data_previous`
      has the same structure as `data` and it will be updated
      whenever `data` changes, either through a callback or
      by editing the table.
      This is a read-only property: setting this property will not
      have any impact on the table.
      - `data_timestamp` (optional): The unix timestamp when the data was last edited.
      Use this property with other timestamp properties
      (such as `n_clicks_timestamp` in `dash_html_components`)
      to determine which property has changed within a callback.
      - `derived_filter_query_structure` (Dict; optional): This property represents the current structure of
      `filter_query` as a tree structure. Each node of the
      query structure has:
      type (string; required):
        'open-block',
        'logical-operator',
        'relational-operator',
        'unary-operator', or
        'expression';
      subType (string; optional):
        'open-block': '()',
        'logical-operator': '&&', '||',
        'relational-operator': '=', '>=', '>', '<=', '<', '!=', 'contains',
        'unary-operator': '!', 'is bool', 'is even', 'is nil', 'is num', 'is object', 'is odd', 'is prime', 'is str',
        'expression': 'value', 'field';
      value (any):
        'expression, value': passed value,
        'expression, field': the field/prop name.
      block (nested query structure; optional).
      left (nested query structure; optional).
      right (nested query structure; optional).
      If the query is invalid or empty, the `derived_filter_query_structure` will
      be null.
      - `derived_viewport_data` (Array of Dicts; optional): This property represents the current state of `data`
      on the current page. This property will be updated
      on paging, sorting, and filtering.
      - `derived_viewport_indices` (Array of s; optional): `derived_viewport_indices` indicates the order in which the original
      rows appear after being filtered, sorted, and/or paged.
      `derived_viewport_indices` contains indices for the current page,
      while `derived_virtual_indices` contains indices across all pages.
      - `derived_viewport_row_ids` (Array of Strings; optional): `derived_viewport_row_ids` lists row IDs in the order they appear
      after being filtered, sorted, and/or paged.
      `derived_viewport_row_ids` contains IDs for the current page,
      while `derived_virtual_row_ids` contains IDs across all pages.
      - `derived_viewport_selected_columns` (Array of Strings; optional): `derived_viewport_selected_columns` contains the ids of the
      `selected_columns` that are not currently hidden.
      - `derived_viewport_selected_row_ids` (Array of Strings; optional): `derived_viewport_selected_row_ids` represents the IDs of the
      `selected_rows` on the currently visible page.
      - `derived_viewport_selected_rows` (Array of s; optional): `derived_viewport_selected_rows` represents the indices of the
      `selected_rows` from the perspective of the `derived_viewport_indices`.
      - `derived_virtual_data` (Array of Dicts; optional): This property represents the visible state of `data`
      across all pages after the front-end sorting and filtering
      as been applied.
      - `derived_virtual_indices` (Array of s; optional): `derived_virtual_indices` indicates the order in which the original
      rows appear after being filtered and sorted.
      `derived_viewport_indices` contains indices for the current page,
      while `derived_virtual_indices` contains indices across all pages.
      - `derived_virtual_row_ids` (Array of Strings; optional): `derived_virtual_row_ids` indicates the row IDs in the order in which
      they appear after being filtered and sorted.
      `derived_viewport_row_ids` contains IDs for the current page,
      while `derived_virtual_row_ids` contains IDs across all pages.
      - `derived_virtual_selected_row_ids` (Array of Strings; optional): `derived_virtual_selected_row_ids` represents the IDs of the
      `selected_rows` as they appear after filtering and sorting,
      across all pages.
      - `derived_virtual_selected_rows` (Array of s; optional): `derived_virtual_selected_rows` represents the indices of the
       `selected_rows` from the perspective of the `derived_virtual_indices`.
      - `dropdown` (Dict with Strings as keys and values of type lists containing elements clearable, options   - `clearable` (Bool; optional)   - `options` (Array of lists containing elements label, value   - `label` (String; required)   - `value` (String | Bool; required)s; required); optional): `dropdown` specifies dropdown options for different columns.
      Each entry refers to the column ID.
      The `clearable` property defines whether the value can be deleted.
      The `options` property refers to the `options` of the dropdown.
      - `dropdown_conditional` (Array of lists containing elements clearable, if, options   - `clearable` (Bool; optional)   - `if` (lists containing elements column_id, filter_query   - `column_id` (String; optional)   - `filter_query` (String; optional); optional)   - `options` (Array of lists containing elements label, value   - `label` (String; required)   - `value` (String | Bool; required)s; required)s; optional): `dropdown_conditional` specifies dropdown options in various columns and cells.
      This property allows you to specify different dropdowns
      depending on certain conditions. For example, you may
      render different "city" dropdowns in a row depending on the
      current value in the "state" column.
      - `dropdown_data` (Array of Dict with Strings as keys and values of type lists containing elements clearable, options   - `clearable` (Bool; optional)   - `options` (Array of lists containing elements label, value   - `label` (String; required)   - `value` (String | Bool; required)s; required)s; optional): `dropdown_data` specifies dropdown options on a row-by-row, column-by-column basis.
      Each item in the array corresponds to the corresponding dropdowns for the `data` item
      at the same index. Each entry in the item refers to the Column ID.
      - `editable` (Bool; optional): If True, then the data in all of the cells is editable.
      When `editable` is True, particular columns can be made
      uneditable by setting `editable` to `False` inside the `columns`
      property.
      If False, then the data in all of the cells is uneditable.
      When `editable` is False, particular columns can be made
      editable by setting `editable` to `True` inside the `columns`
      property.
      - `end_cell` (lists containing elements row, column, row_id, column_id   - `row` (optional)   - `column` (optional)   - `row_id` (String; optional)   - `column_id` (String; optional); optional): When selecting multiple cells

      `start_cell` represents the coordinates of the other corner.
      - `export_columns` ('all', 'visible'; optional): Denotes the columns that will be used in the export data file.

      - `export_format` ('csv', 'xlsx', 'none'; optional): Denotes the type of the export data file,
      Defaults to `'none'`
      - `export_headers` ('none', 'ids', 'names', 'display'; optional): Denotes the format of the headers in the export data file.
      If `'none'`, there will be no header. If `'display'`, then the header
      of the data file will be be how it is currently displayed. Note that
      `'display'` is only supported for `'xlsx'` export_format and will behave
      like `'names'` for `'csv'` export format. If `'ids'` or `'names'`,
      then the headers of data file will be the column id or the column
      names, respectively
      - `fill_width` (Bool; optional): `fill_width` toggles between a set of CSS for two common behaviors:
      True: The table container's width will grow to fill the available space;
      False: The table container's width will equal the width of its content.
      - `filter_action` ('custom', 'native', 'none' | lists containing elements type, operator   - `type` ('custom', 'native'; required)   - `operator` ('and', 'or'; optional); optional): The `filter_action` property controls the behavior of the `filtering` UI.
      If `'none'`, then the filtering UI is not displayed.
      If `'native'`, then the filtering UI is displayed and the filtering
      logic is handled by the table. That is, it is performed on the data
      that exists in the `data` property.
      If `'custom'`, then the filtering UI is displayed but it is the
      responsibility of the developer to program the filtering
      through a callback (where `filter_query` or `derived_filter_query_structure` would be the input
      and `data` would be the output).
      - `filter_query` (String; optional): If `filter_action` is enabled, then the current filtering
      string is represented in this `filter_query`
      property.
      - `fixed_columns` (lists containing elements headers, data   - `headers` (false; optional)   - `data` (0; optional) | lists containing elements headers, data   - `headers` (true; required)   - `data` (optional); optional): `fixed_columns` will "fix" the set of columns so that
      they remain visible when scrolling horizontally across
      the unfixed columns. `fixed_columns` fixes columns
      from left-to-right.
      If `headers` is False, no columns are fixed.
      If `headers` is True, all operation columns (see `row_deletable` and `row_selectable`)
      are fixed. Additional data columns can be fixed by
      assigning a number to `data`.
      Defaults to `{ headers: False }`.
      Note that fixing columns introduces some changes to the
      underlying markup of the table and may impact the
      way that your columns are rendered or sized.
      View the documentation examples to learn more.
      - `fixed_rows` (lists containing elements headers, data   - `headers` (false; optional)   - `data` (0; optional) | lists containing elements headers, data   - `headers` (true; required)   - `data` (optional); optional): `fixed_rows` will "fix" the set of rows so that
      they remain visible when scrolling vertically down
      the table. `fixed_rows` fixes rows
      from top-to-bottom, starting from the headers.
      If `headers` is False, no rows are fixed.
      If `headers` is True, all header and filter rows (see `filter_action`) are
      fixed. Additional data rows can be fixed by assigning
      a number to `data`.
      Defaults to `{ headers: False }`.
      Note that fixing rows introduces some changes to the
      underlying markup of the table and may impact the
      way that your columns are rendered or sized.

      - `hidden_columns` (Array of Strings; optional): List of columns ids of the columns that are currently hidden.
      See the associated nested prop `columns.hideable`.
      - `include_headers_on_copy_paste` (Bool; optional): If true, headers are included when copying from the table to different

      This prop is derived from the [d3.formatLocale](https://github.com/d3/d3-format#formatLocale) data structure specification.
      When left unspecified, each individual nested prop will default to a pre-determined value.
        'symbol': (default: ['$', '']) a list of two strings representing the
        prefix and suffix symbols. Typically used for currency, and implemented using d3's
        currency format, but you can use this for other symbols such as measurement units.
        'decimal': (default: '.') the string used for the decimal separator.
        'group': (default: ',') the string used for the groups separator.
        'grouping': (default: [3]) a list of integers representing the grouping pattern.
        'numerals': a list of ten strings used as replacements for numbers 0-9.

      current tab, and _top opens the link in the top frame) or a string
      - `merge_duplicate_headers` (Bool; optional): If True, then column headers that have neighbors with duplicate names
      will be merged into a single cell.
      This will be applied for single column headers and multi-column
      headers.
      - `page_action` ('custom', 'native', 'none'; optional): `page_action` refers to a mode of the table where
      not all of the rows are displayed at once: only a subset
      are displayed (a "page") and the next subset of rows
      can viewed by clicking "Next" or "Previous" buttons
      at the bottom of the page.
      Pagination is used to improve performance: instead of
      rendering all of the rows at once (which can be expensive),
      we only display a subset of them.
      With pagination, we can either page through data that exists
      in the table (e.g. page through `10,000` rows in `data` `100` rows at a time)
      or we can update the data on-the-fly with callbacks
      when the user clicks on the "Previous" or "Next" buttons.
      These modes can be toggled with this `page_action` parameter:
      `'native'`: all data is passed to the table up-front, paging logic is
      handled by the table;
      `'custom'`: data is passed to the table one page at a time, paging logic
      is handled via callbacks;
      `none`: disables paging, render all of the data at once.
      - `page_count` (optional): `page_count` represents the number of the pages in the
      paginated table. This is really only useful when performing
      backend pagination, since the front end is able to use the
      full size of the table to calculate the number of pages.
      - `page_current` (optional): `page_current` represents which page the user is on.
      Use this property to index through data in your callbacks with
      backend paging.
      - `page_size` (optional): `page_size` represents the number of rows that will be
      displayed on a particular page when `page_action` is `'custom'` or `'native'`
      - `persisted_props` (Array of 'columns.name', 'data', 'filter_query', 'hidden_columns', 'selected_columns', 'selected_rows', 'sort_by's; optional): Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing the
      component or the page.
      - `persistence` (Bool | String; optional): Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted when
      the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is truthy and
      hasn't changed from its previous value, any `persisted_props` that the
      user has changed while using the app will keep those changes, as long as
      the new prop value also matches what was given originally.
      Used in conjunction with `persistence_type` and `persisted_props`.
      - `persistence_type` ('local', 'session', 'memory'; optional): Where persisted user changes will be stored:
      memory: only kept in memory, reset on page refresh.
      local: window.localStorage, data is kept after the browser quit.
      session: window.sessionStorage, data is cleared once the browser quit.
      - `row_deletable` (Bool; optional): If True, then a `x` will appear next to each `row`
      and the user can delete the row.
      - `row_selectable` ('single', 'multi', false; optional): If `single`, then the user can select a single row
      via a radio button that will appear next to each row.
      If `multi`, then the user can select multiple rows
      via a checkbox that will appear next to each row.
      If false, then the user will not be able to select rows
      and no additional UI elements will appear.
      When a row is selected, its index will be contained
      in `selected_rows`.
      - `selected_cells` (Array of lists containing elements row, column, row_id, column_id   - `row` (optional)   - `column` (optional)   - `row_id` (String; optional)   - `column_id` (String; optional)s; optional): `selected_cells` represents the set of cells that are selected,
      as an array of objects, each item similar to `active_cell`.
      Multiple cells can be selected by holding down shift and
      clicking on a different cell or holding down shift and navigating
      with the arrow keys.
      - `selected_columns` (Array of Strings; optional): `selected_columns` contains the ids of columns that
      are selected via the UI elements that appear when
      `column_selectable` is `'single' or 'multi'`.
      - `selected_row_ids` (Array of Strings; optional): `selected_row_ids` contains the ids of rows that
      are selected via the UI elements that appear when
      `row_selectable` is `'single'` or `'multi'`.
      - `selected_rows` (Array of s; optional): `selected_rows` contains the indices of rows that
      are selected via the UI elements that appear when
      `row_selectable` is `'single'` or `'multi'`.
      - `sort_action` ('custom', 'native', 'none'; optional): The `sort_action` property enables data to be
      sorted on a per-column basis.
      If `'none'`, then the sorting UI is not displayed.
      If `'native'`, then the sorting UI is displayed and the sorting
      logic is hanled by the table. That is, it is performed on the data
      that exists in the `data` property.
      If `'custom'`, the the sorting UI is displayed but it is the
      responsibility of the developer to program the sorting
      through a callback (where `sort_by` would be the input and `data`
      would be the output).
      Clicking on the sort arrows will update the
      `sort_by` property.
      - `sort_as_null` (Array of String | Bools; optional): An array of string, number and boolean values that are treated as `null`
      (i.e. ignored and always displayed last) when sorting.
      This value will be used by columns without `sort_as_null`.
      Defaults to `[]`.
      - `sort_by` (Array of lists containing elements column_id, direction   - `column_id` (String; required)   - `direction` ('asc', 'desc'; required)s; optional): `sort_by` describes the current state
      of the sorting UI.
      That is, if the user clicked on the sort arrow
      of a column, then this property will be updated
      with the column ID and the direction
      (`asc` or `desc`) of the sort.
      For multi-column sorting, this will be a list of
      sorting parameters, in the order in which they were
      clicked.
      - `sort_mode` ('single', 'multi'; optional): Sorting can be performed across multiple columns
      (e.g. sort by country, sort within each country,
       sort by year) or by a single column.
      NOTE - With multi-column sort, it's currently
      not possible to determine the order in which
      the columns were sorted through the UI.

      If set to `null`, the tooltip will not disappear.
      Alternatively, the value of the property can also be
      a plain string or a nully value to . The `text` syntax will be used in
      that case.
      - `virtualization` (Bool; optional): This property tells the table to use virtualization when rendering.
      Assumptions are that:
      the width of the columns is fixed;
      the height of the rows is always the same; and
      runtime styling changes will not affect width and height vs. first rendering
